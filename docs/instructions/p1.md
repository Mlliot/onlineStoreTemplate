# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

Our group will be making an online movie ticket booking application.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A short description of the requirement. This should be a single sentence that describes the requirement. Do not replace the word `Description` with the actual description. Put the description in the space where these instructions are written. Maintain that practice for all future sections.
  - **Type:** The type of requirement. Should be either `Functional` or `Non-Functional`.
  - **Priority:** The priority of the requirement. This should be a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority.

- **ID:** REQ-3 
  - **Description:** Tickets hold data which can be used to point to a specific movie in the database.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** If a ticket doesn't point to a specific movie, it is useless.
  - **Testing:** Ensure the ticket can be used to pull a movie reliably from the database.

- **ID:** REQ-4 
  - **Description:** Payment processing and ticket confirmation.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** This enables users to make secure online payments and receive confirmed tickets, ensuring reliable transactions.

- **ID:** REQ-5 
  - **Description:** Movie showtimes and seat selection.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:** It allows users to view available movie showtimes and select their preferred seats.

- **ID:** REQ-6 
  - **Description:** User registrations and profile management.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** Allows users to register and create accounts, making it a personal experience and enabling them to manage their booking history, preferences, and any rewards they earned. 
  - **Testing:** Can be tested by simulating the user registration process, making sure that users can successfully sign up, log in, update their profile info, and view their past bookings. Also, checking for proper error handling in case of invalid inputs during any moment of the process in another test. 

- **ID:** REQ-7
- **Description:** Users should be able to search for movies by providing movie titles, their preferred locations or movie genres, price ranges.
- **Type:** Functional
- **Priority:** 1
- **Rationale:** The search functionality is key since any other function will be performed only after users find movies, they are interested in.

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

Can be accessed online until September 2023. Can be accessed on any modern operating system. 
The application needs to be created in a tight project timeline. The application must be developed to be fully responsive and usable across various devices including phones/tablets/etc.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

  - **Description:** A description of the use case that gives the user a high-level overview of how the system is interacted with.
  - **Actors:** A list of the actors that are involved in the use case. Only include the actors that are directly involved. Actors are the people or things that interact with the system. For example, when ordering at a fast food restaurant, one might have the following actors: the customer, the cashier, and the cook. But only the customer and the cashier are directly involved in the use case of ordering food. The cook is not directly involved in the use case of ordering food.
  - **Preconditions:** A list of the preconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the preconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met before the use case can be executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have money in their wallet and the cashier must be logged in to the system before the use case of ordering food can be executed.
  - **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have their food and the cashier must have the customer's money after the use case of ordering food has been executed.
